            I am a passionate web developer with hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive web applications. Proficient in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient code. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I specialize in creating full-stack solutions that are scalable and user-friendly.
            <br /> <br />
            I am adept at solving complex problems and thrive in environments where teamwork and collaboration are key. While I am confident in my technical skills, I believe in the importance of continuous learning and growth. I approach every project with a focus on clear communication and adaptability, and Iâ€™m always open to guidance to ensure the best possible outcomes.
